# Brain In Vat

Brain In Vat is a Chrome extension designed to leverage Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) and Artificial Intelligence (AI) to extract and process information from the webpage a user is currently viewing. This project aims to provide a seamless way to gather and analyze web data without manual intervention, enhancing the user's browsing experience while ensuring data privacy by storing all data locally.

## Features

- **Local Data Storage**: All extracted data is stored locally on the user's machine, ensuring privacy and data security.
- **Information Retrieval**: Automatically extracts relevant information from the current webpage.
- **Retrieval-Augmented Generation**: Utilizes RAG to provide contextual understanding and generate human-like text based on the retrieved information.
- **Real-Time Analysis**: Processes the extracted data in real-time, aiding in instant decision-making and information gathering.
